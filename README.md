	- "Hafner et al. MS cranial morphometrics_2025.xls":  This file contains the raw data for 441 specimens across the original 20 variables.  Note (as explained in the text), our discriminant function analyses were based on 387 specimens (337/441 specimens had complete cranial data for the 14 variables used in our study).  
	- "Hafner et al. MS colorimetrics_2025.xls":  This file contains the raw data for 678 specimens across 8 variables.  Again as explained in the text, our discriminant function analyses were based on 678 specimens and using only 3 variables.
